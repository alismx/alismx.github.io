# DevSecOps

I'm Alis, a DevOps engineer passionate about open-source, cloud-native technologies, and public health. I'm currently working at [Skylight](https://skylight.digital) on projects that enable public health agencies to leverage modern, cloud-based software solutions. Feel free to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/alismx) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alismx).
